I told her she was going to live forever at this rate. Boy, was I wrong! She eventually developed a condition where she couldn‚Äôt swallow. Her esophagus eventually got weaker and weaker until she couldn‚Äôt ingest enough nourishment to sustain her life. She passed away on January 23, 2006, at 7:45 PM. Her four children were with her‚Äîthree physically by her side and one on the phone‚Äîalong with several grandchildren, including Lisa, who had cared for her and been her nearly constant companion for the past seven months. She passed very peacefully. This page is not about the mourning of her death but rather a celebration of her life."

The ceilings went up forever, and everywhere you looked was marble. The seating was like an amphitheater, and the altar was magnificent. Her granddaughter Lisa, who has taken care of her for the past seven months, did the bible reading from the Old Testament, and her eldest granddaughter Jennifer did the New Testament reading. Her eldest grandson, Vincent, read the General Intercessions, and two of her great-grandchildren, Briana and Michael, brought up the offertory gifts. The pastor even asked me to assist with communion. I had mentioned that I was a Eucharistic Minister, but I never expected to be in the Mass. It came as a complete surprise."

Every Sunday, she would get up early to attend Mass so that she could come home and start cooking the Sunday dinner by 9:00 AM. A big pot of gravy would always be simmering on the stove, cooking and cooking. Somehow, Dad always found a way to steal a few fried meatballs before they made it into the gravy. On special occasions, she would make homemade macaroni. The whole family would make homemade Ravioli, with each member taking their part in a giant assembly line that started in the kitchen and ended on a white floured sheet in the bedroom."
